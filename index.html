        <h2>📜 My Story</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up in a country where Game Development as a profession didn't exist when I was graduating a high school. My childhood dream was to make video games, but I had to chose a 'real' profession.
        </p>

        <p>
          I chose to study Telecommunication Engineering at the University, because I wanted to understand how information technologies work on the physical level! Getting a BSc in Radio / Telecom helped me build a solid foundation in Math and Physics, which helped me a lot in studying Programming in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          My early career was in Technical / Engineering Sales roles in Health Tech and IT industry, which helped me save up enough money to move to Vancouver.
        </p>

        <p>
           In Vancouver, I've realized that a career in Game Development is more than just a dream! It inspired me to learn Programming and I succesfully switched my career into Software Development here!
